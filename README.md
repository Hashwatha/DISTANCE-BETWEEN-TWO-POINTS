# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula

### Step 4: 
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1 = 10
x2 = 4
y1 = 6
y2 = 2
d = math.sqrt(((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2))
print("%.2f" % d)
```
  


### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the distance of the two points is sucessfully executed and displayed.
